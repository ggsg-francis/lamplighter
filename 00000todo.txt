TODO --------------------------------------------------------------------
X. fix caterpillar buffer bug
X. form animator struct and add new one for upper body
X. enclose character data in a struct (semi-OO shift)
X. fix the any type vector (varbuf)
X. switch to use buffer of pointers to entity/chara structs
X. phase in indexed resources
X. add metadata to animations (eg. fire projectile on step X, or on complete...)
X. follow npc will path to the nearest player, not just player 0
X. fix vector error with pathfinding
X. button to enter 'aiming mode'
X. finish implementing tick function pointer array
*. finish implementing draw function pointer array
X. add local transformations to Transform3D
?. add parented matrices to Transform3D
X. fix X flipped 3d models
*. fix X flipped 3d models more properly
*. implementation of aiming mode via lowerAni animation (character rotates to view direction, walking exits animation)
X. add operable matchlock gun
*. Make matchlock into an isolated object (tick function, draw function...)
~. individualize matchlock input
~. train AI to use matchlock
*. animate arms mesh
*. new gambeson model
*. assign upper animator to arms
*. if during aim animation chara can enter attack animation, which utilizes the fire on step animeta
*. follow npc shoots at nearest player when they come within a range (utilize already implemented faction system)
*. set character's bodies to align with their view direction when the difference angle is sufficiently large (owl neck prevention)
*. get rid of object oriented draw functions on graphics::newmesh and modelblend
*. set resources getBTX to return gl index instead of object reference
*. get rid of the above classes entirely (?)
~. add different behaviour types
~. add a third type of character
~. new data for levels that spawns a character template on level load
~. place spawn points around the map
~. add text renderer
~. remove pRes & resources object
~. add btm3 (blend mesh with 3rd 'intermediate' mesh)
~. character inventory?
~. character equipped items?
?. return to object oriented style
